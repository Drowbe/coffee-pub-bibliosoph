## üìñ Usage Guide

### Card Format

To build a nicely formatted card, all you need to do is leverage the markup built right into foundry. Anything you put within "blockquote" tag will be formatted as a card. This DOES MEAN that if you plan to use blockquote for other reasons, any of that content will be formatted accordingly.

```html
<blockquote>
    <h4>Card Title</h4> 
    <p>Some narrative here.</p>
    <h5>Image Title</h5>
    <img src="link to image">
    <hr>
    <p>Optional additional narrative</p>
    <h6><strong>Name of Speaker</strong> "The words the speaker is saying."</h6>
    <h6><em>Inner Dialogue</em> "The text that the player is thinking"</h6>
</blockquote>
```

As we add more layout elements to Scribe, we will update this simple framework as necessary.
